Thus, a query and a document, represented as two vectors in the lower-dimensional semantic space, can still have a high similarity score even if they do not share any term. (2) These semantic matching models are often trained in an unsupervised manner using an objective function that is only loosely coupled with the evaluation metric for the retrieval task. Thus the performance of these models on Web search tasks is not as good as originally expected.|
