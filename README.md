A ranking problem is different from classification or regression tasks, the latters aim to predict a label or a value for each individual item as accurately as possible; the goal of the former is to sort the entire item list, with items of higher relevance being prioritized. In a ranking problem, we are more concerned with the relative order of the relevance of items than their absolute magnitudes.

learning-to-rank methods: fall into one of pointwise, pairwise, or listwise classes, pairwise and listwise methods are more closely aligned with the ranking task.
