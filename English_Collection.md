> "Learning Deep Structured Semantic Models for Web Search using Clickthrough Data"有两段英文描述keyphrase-based matching与unsupervised IR的文字很好记录一下:

These latent semantic models address the language discrepancy between Web documents and search queries by grouping different terms that occur in a similar context into the same semantic cluster. Thus, a query and a document, represented as two vectors in the lower-dimensional semantic space, can still have a high similarity score even if they do not share any term.

These semantic matching models are often trained in an unsupervised manner using an objective function that is only loosely coupled with the evaluation metric for the retrieval task. Thus the performance of these models on Web search tasks is not as good as originally expected.

> DeepRank: A New Deep Architecture for Relevance Ranking in Information Retrieval 对前人工作的总结很棒

A ranking list is produced by sorting in descending order of the relevance score.
